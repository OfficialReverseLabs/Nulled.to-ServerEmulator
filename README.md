# Nulled.to-Server Emulator

Server Emulator for https://www.nulled.to/authkeys. Made by  &amp; https://github.com/FaxHack

# How it works

It starts a HTTPS Server, using NetCoreServer, after it modifies Hosts File, in order to allow HTTPS Redirection.

It generates valid response, with random credentials. It also uses Max Rank possible, Supreme (Worth 60 $).

# IS THAT A BYPASS?

Absolutely NO. This program IS NOT a Nulled.to Bypass, as its purpose is only to emulate the Nulled.to Auth Server, and this can be done by every program, or even manually!

So please, do not call my Emulator, a "Bypass", because you would spread false informations.

It is not Nulled.to's fault. They provide a great Auth system.

THIS IS NOT THE SAME EMULATION AS Nulled.to Auth "BYPASSES". THE TERM EMULATION HERE REFERS TO "EMULATING" A PUBLIC SERVER BY USING THE SAME Nulled.to Auth APPLICATION INFORMATION TO MAKE THIS TOOL LOOKS LIKE THE SERVER. IT DOES NOT INTERACT WITH THE PROGRAM'S MEMORY IN ANY WAY.

# How to use

- Run "CertificateBypass.pfx".

- Select "Local PC".

- Insert the password: "shiba".

- Add it in Trusted Root CA Folder.

- Press enter.

- Now you can start the Emulator without problem.

# Requirement's

# DMCA VIOLATIONS
Does this projects violates DMCA? Absolutely not.

This program only show a method that can be done manually without any problem. It is basically a clone of the original nulled.to auth Server. This can be done by everyone, and it does not interact with Process Memory.

It does not modify programs in any way.
